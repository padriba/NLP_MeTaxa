# NLP_MeTaxa
NLP-MeTaxa is a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for taxonomic assignments, trained with DNA fragments represented by word2vec embeddings.
The NLP-MeTaxa was evaluated on three datasets used in the first CAMI challenge, where the complexity is gradually ascendant among them, from the low until the high complexity dataset.
